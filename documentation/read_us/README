BEOS Mail Daemon Replacement v1.0.0 beta 5

ABOUT:

This is a drop-in replacement for the BeOS Mail Daemon that comes with
BeOS. Its purpose is to be 100% compatible with the original mail_daemon
and to improve it by adding features. The package contains the following
files:

  README
   The file you are reading.

  LICENSE
   Conditions for using/distributing this package.

  libmail2.so
   This library provides the backend for the new mail_daemon. This is an
   exception in the package, as it *DOES NOT* replace the original 
   libmail.so, but complements it. It will be installed in 
   /boot/home/config/lib

  mail_daemon
   This is the new replacement Mail Daemon. It will be installed in 
   /boot/beos/system/servers, overwriting the original mail_daemon file.

  E-mail
   This is the new e-mail preferences panel. It will be installed to 
   /boot/beos/preferences, overwriting the original preferences app.


***********

  Warning:

  Do not keep this and other mail_daemon executables on your HD!
  Because the original Mail Kit uses the mail_daemon's signature
  to find it, having more than one version will cause things to
  randomly fail, when it fins the old version instead of the new.

  This software is beta quality! See the LICENSE file for more 	
  information.

***********

INSTALLATION:

Installation is through a zip file. Be sure to download the correct 
version for your system (PPC or x86). Just unzip the file somewhere
and double click the install.sh icon.

The installer will offer to make a backup or purge old mail daemons.
We STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you accept one or the other of these offers.
The backup/purge proceedure removes all extraneous copies of the
mail_daemon from your system, which is a common cause of other prob-
lems.

To configure the new mail_daemon, open the E-mail preferences app
from your Deskbar menu after installing the package.

Note: The x86 version in this package *DOES NOT* work under BONE;
if you are using BONE you must use a different version compiled
for BONE.  If you don't know where to find this, you should not
be using BONE!

USAGE:

Open the E-mail preferences app (BeOS Menu/Preferences/E-mail) and 
configure your accounts. To save all the changes, close the window
by clicking "Save".  To delete an account, select it and press the
DEL key or use the Remove button.

Right click the Deskbar mail icon to access a menu with various options 
(and to select your default account for sending emails).  Single-click
the icon to open your mail inbox.

PROTOCOLS INSTALLATION:

Protocol add-ons should be installed in /boot/home/config/add-ons/
mail_daemon/protocols. This directory will be automatically created by
the installation process. The distribution contains POP3 (with APOP 
support) and SMTP protocols.
