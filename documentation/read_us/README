BEOS Mail Daemon Replacement v2.0.0 Beta 1

ABOUT:

This is a drop-in replacement for the BeOS Mail Daemon that comes with
BeOS. Its purpose is to be 100% compatible with the original mail_daemon
and to improve it by adding features. The package contains the following
files:

  README
   The file you are reading.

  LICENSE
   Conditions for using/distributing this package.

  DANGER, WILL ROBINSON
   The reasons this is not a final release. You really should read this.

  libmail.so
   This library provides the backend for the new mail_daemon.
   It will be installed in /boot/beos/system/lib

  mail_daemon
   This is the new replacement Mail Daemon. It will be installed in 
   /boot/beos/system/servers, overwriting the original mail_daemon file.

  BeMail
   This is a new version of BeMail, based on the original, which Be has,
   in their infinite wisdom, open sourced. This provides full multi-account
   support, among other things. Great stuff. It will be installed in
   /boot/beos/apps/BeMail

  E-mail
   This is the new e-mail preferences panel. It will be installed to 
   /boot/beos/preferences, overwriting the original preferences app.

  Addons
   There are a *lot* of addons. These contain much of the functionality
   of the mail daemon, and will be installed in
   /boot/home/config/add-ons/mail_daemon


***********

  Warning:

  Do not keep this and other mail_daemon executables on your HD!
  Because the original Mail Kit uses the mail_daemon's signature
  to find it, having more than one version will cause things to
  randomly fail, when it finds the old version instead of the new.

  This software is alpha quality! See the LICENSE file for more 	
  information.

***********

INSTALLATION:

Installation is through a zip file. Be sure to download the correct 
version for your system (PPC or x86). Just unzip the file somewhere
and double click the install.sh icon.

The installer will offer to make a backup or purge old mail daemons.
We STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you accept one or the other of these offers.
The backup/purge proceedure removes all extraneous copies of the
mail_daemon from your system, which is a common cause of other prob-
lems.

To configure the new mail_daemon, open the E-mail preferences app
from your Deskbar menu after installing the package.

Note: The x86 version in this package *DOES NOT* work under BONE;
if you are using BONE you must use a different version compiled
for BONE.  If you don't know where to find this, you should not
be using BONE!

USAGE:

Open the E-mail preferences app (BeOS Menu/Preferences/E-mail) and 
configure your accounts. To save all the changes, close the window
by clicking "Save".  To delete an account, select it and press the
DEL key or use the Remove button.

Right click the Deskbar mail icon to access a menu with various options.
Single-click the icon to open your mail inbox. The field about new messages
will be available for selection if you have new messages, and will open a
Tracker query displaying those messages. The Quit option quits the
mail_daemon. You don't want to do this. Right-clicking the Deskbar replicant
while pressing the SHIFT key reveals more options for Sending/Receiving 
emails.

ADDON INSTALLATION:

Add-ons should be installed in /boot/home/config/add-ons/
mail_daemon/ in the subdirectory specified in the add on documentation.
This directory will be automatically created by the installation process.
The distribution contains POP3 (with APOP support), IMAP and SMTP (including 
SMTP-Auth) protocols, as well as Add Fortune, R5 Daemon Filter, and Match
Header filters.

FILTERS:

This release contains three filter addons. To enable them, use E-mail Filters
in preferences, and choose the appropriate direction to apply them in
(specified below), then add that filter. You can add several instances of
the same filter type, although this is only reccomended for RuleFilter. Addons
will be executed in the order they appear in the list, and can be reorderd with
a simple drag and drop. To install new filters, follow the directions in 
ADDON INSTALLATION.

 Add Fortune
   This filter adds a random fortune to the bottom of all outgoing e-mail. For
   an example, open your Terminal and type fortune. The database can be
   specified in config, although it is highly reccomended that you use the
   default. For more information on Fortune and its database format, go look
   somewhere on the web.

 R5 Daemon Filter
   This filter executes old style mail daemon filters on inbound messages.
   For more information, see http://www.betips.net/chunga.php?ID=511

 Match Header
   Allows you to filter messages based on an arbitrary header, of a value
   you define. The value can be a regex. So to trash messages containing
   "get rich quick" in the subject, do this: If |Subject| is |*get rich quick*|
   Then |Delete Message| The ||, of course, are just the edges of the
   text boxes. Or, to put it messages from BeUserTalk in ~/mail/beusertalk:
   If |Subject| is |*BeUserTalk*| Then |Move To| |/boot/home/mail/beusertalk|
   This works for any header field. Also, THREAD is a special header
   containing (you guessed it!) the message thread.
