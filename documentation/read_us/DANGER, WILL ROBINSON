BEOS Mail Daemon Replacement v2.1.0 Release Candidate 3

BEEP! THIS IS A TEST OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM.

KNOWN BUGS AND UPDATE DANGERS

There are a few bugs in this version of the Mail Daemon Replacement. (Would this be a beta otherwise?) We will only admit that two of them are bugs, but the rest are things that you really should be aware of.

BUGS:

1) Your inbox *must* be on your boot disk. We'll have a fix for this soon (or perhaps not), but be aware of this. If you don't, you will soon start seeing errors about cross-device links (it initially creates the mail files in /tmp and then moves them to inbox) and all your mail will be deleted. Don't say we didn't warn you. The e-mail monster is hiding in a cross-device link. Don't bring him out!

2) Sometimes the new message count is wrong.  Quit and restart the daemon if this upsets you.  This is due to a BeOS BFS queries bug, which we can't fix, since it's in the kernel. When OpenBFS is released (or so says BGA), this will cease to be a problem. You may praise or curse BGA at your leisure for either fixing it or for taking so long. Your choice.

3) The soonness of the dates mentioned in this file is greatly exaggerated. Please volunteer to fix bugs to correct this.


IT'S NOT A BUG, IT'S A FEATURE:

1) If you were using IMAP before, and use IMAP now, it will redownload all your messages. There's nothing I can do to stop it. But it will only do it once. And you can set it to only download the headers now, which is a good thing, right? I mean, you don't need to redownload the 15 MB of baby pictures from your Aunt Martha again, now do you?

2) The settings in things like Postmaster and the old e-mail prefs that used the settings of the old mail daemon will no longer be able to save settings. They will however be able to read them, since we were nice and added that feature. But what are you doing using Postmaster anyway?

3) There may be some difficulties with using multiple filters. This is an unconfirmed issue, so we won't actually say that it exists. It might, though. And if it does exist, we'll fix by the next release. Probably.

THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. WE WILL NOW RETURN TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAM. BEEP!
